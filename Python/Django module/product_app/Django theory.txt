### 4. **Explain what `django-admin.py makemessages` command is used for?**

### 5. **What is Django URLs?**

In Django, URLs are handled using a URL dispatcher which maps URL patterns to views. This allows Django to know what code to execute when a certain URL is requested. The `urls.py` file is used to define this mapping.
